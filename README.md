# python-challenge  Nicholas Best
This challenge was to use the tools learned to read .csv files and pull specific data, print them along with creating an output txt with the results.  Also to start using Git Push, Pull, and ADD.
I was able to sucesfully complete all tasks on the PyBank challenge, but did stumble a bit on the PyPoll needed to seek help with the Candidate names information, I was able to print them, however the output txt did not result in what it should have
